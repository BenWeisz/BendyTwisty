# Bendy Twisty

Discrete Elastic Rods based on Columbia [Paper](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/pdfs/143-rods.pdf) by Miklos Bergou

The goal of this repo is to replicate the work presented in the paper as well as recreate the tree blowing in the wind animation from the paper.

The engine base is my other repo [ModelEngine](https://github.com/BenWeisz/ModelEngine)

Work in progress:

- I'm currently working through implementing some of the energy gradients and adding tests
