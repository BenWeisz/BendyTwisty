Discrete Elastic Rods based on Columbia [Paper](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/pdfs/143-rods.pdf) by Miklos Bergou

The goal of this repo is to replicate the work presented in the paper as well as recreate the tree blowing in the wind animation from the paper.

The engine base is my other repo [ModelEngine](https://github.com/BenWeisz/ModelEngine)

Most of the custom code for the rods can be found under ```include/custom/rod```

Work in progress:

- I'm currently working through implementing some of the energy gradients and adding tests using catch2
